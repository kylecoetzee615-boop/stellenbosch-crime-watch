This README:

- Explains **purpose and features** clearly.  
- Shows **map legend** for easy understanding.  
- Gives **instructions for submission, voting, and neighborhood search**.  
- Includes a **diagram of the app flow** for quick comprehension.  
- Notes **deployment and setup instructions** for anyone maintaining it.

If you want, I can **also create a short version of the README for WhatsApp or community posters**, so people who aren’t tech-savvy can understand how to use the app quickly.  

Do you want me to make that?
